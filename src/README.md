# Project Overview

This project is a Node.js-based payment processing application. Below is a detailed explanation of the files, their importance, the code execution flow, and steps to execute the application.

---

## File Structure and Importance

### 1. `index.js`
- **Purpose**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the server and sets up the routes.
- **Importance**: Without this file, the application cannot start.

### 2. `routes/paymentRoutes.js`
- **Purpose**: Defines the API endpoints for payment-related operations.
- **Importance**: Handles the routing logic for payment processing.

### 3. `controllers/paymentController.js`
- **Purpose**: Contains the business logic for processing payments.
- **Importance**: Acts as the intermediary between the routes and the services.

### 4. `services/paymentService.js`
- **Purpose**: Handles the core payment processing logic, such as interacting with payment gateways.
- **Importance**: Encapsulates the main functionality of the application.

### 5. `models/paymentModel.js`
- **Purpose**: Defines the database schema for storing payment-related data.
- **Importance**: Ensures data consistency and structure in the database.

### 6. `config/db.js`
- **Purpose**: Configures and establishes the database connection.
- **Importance**: Without this file, the application cannot interact with the database.

### 7. `middlewares/errorHandler.js`
- **Purpose**: Handles errors and exceptions in the application.
- **Importance**: Ensures the application runs smoothly by catching and managing errors.

### 8. `package.json`
- **Purpose**: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
- **Importance**: Essential for installing and running the application.

## Code Execution Flow

1. **Application Initialization**:
    - The `index.js` file starts the server and sets up the routes.

2. **Routing**:
    - Requests are routed to `routes/paymentRoutes.js` based on the endpoint.

3. **Controller Logic**:
    - The `paymentController.js` processes the request and calls the appropriate service.

4. **Service Logic**:
    - The `paymentService.js` performs the core payment processing tasks.

5. **Database Interaction**:
    - The `paymentModel.js` interacts with the database to store or retrieve data.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - Any errors are caught and managed by `middlewares/errorHandler.js`.

## Steps to Execute the Code

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add the required variables (e.g., database URL, API keys).

3. **Start the Database**:
    - Ensure your database server is running.

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the API**:
    - Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.

6. **Monitor Logs**:
    - Check the console or log files for any errors or status updates.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and environment variables are correctly configured.
- Refer to the API documentation (if available) for detailed endpoint usage.

## Postman Collections

To simplify testing and interacting with the API, a Postman collection is provided. Follow the steps below to use it:

### Steps to Import the Collection

1. **Locate the Collection**:
    - The `local_postman_collection.json` file is available in the project directory.

2. **Open Postman**:
    - Launch the Postman application on your system.

3. **Import the Collection**:
    - Click on the "Import" button in Postman.
    - Select the `local_postman_collection.json` file and import it.

4. **Set Up Authorization**:
    - After logging in to the application, retrieve the user token.
    - Use the token in the "Authorization" tab of Postman by selecting "Bearer Token" and pasting the token.

5. **Test the Endpoints**:
    - Use the imported collection to test the API endpoints. Each request is pre-configured with the necessary headers and parameters.

### Notes
- Ensure the application is running before testing the endpoints.
- Update the environment variables in Postman to match your local setup (e.g., base URL, API keys).
- Refer to the comments in the collection for additional details about each request.
